## What is CoreSync?

[CoreSync](https://coresync.dev) is a Commodity Resource Intelligence Platform connecting resoure projects with cloud performance.  CoreSync v1.0 launches with secure, rapid, web-based sharing of 3D resource models in the industry-standard Open Mining Format (OMF), promoting collaboration over static screenshots and PDFs. We simplify cloud integration for resource projects, starting with sharing complex project data.

## Who is CoreSync for?

CoreSync is designed for a wide range of users in the resource industry, including:

*   Geologists
*   Consultants
*   Mining engineers
*   Project managers
*   Investors
*   Local community members
*   Teams within small to medium-sized resource companies
*   Large organizations with complex resource modeling requirements

## Key Benefits of Using CoreSync v1.0

*   **Democratize Insights:** Empower everyone to discover insights from your data with interactive 3D visuals.
*   **Drive Down Costs:** Gain efficiency and simplify complexity by unifying data sharing.
*   **Instant, Secure Sharing:** Share 3D models instantly with a simple URL. No downloads or specialized software required for viewers.
*   **Broad Compatibility:** Works with data from leading software (Seequent Leapfrog Geo, Deswik, Micromine, Datamine, Dassault Syst√®mes 3DEXPERIENCE, and Mira Geoscience).
*   **Rapid Processing:**  Models are typically processed within a couple of hours.
*   **Secure Data Management:** Industry-standard encryption protects your data.
*   **Easy Uploading:** Streamlined process for managing multiple models.
*   **Responsive Support:**  Our dedicated team is here to help.

## Use Cases

CoreSync helps streamline various workflows across the resource industry:

*   **Drilling Program Updates:** Keep stakeholders informed with interactive 3D visualizations of drilling progress.
*   **Consultant-Client Collaboration:**  Share geoscientific models with clients, eliminating large file transfers.
*   **Cross-disciplinary Internal Collaboration:** Facilitate real-time collaboration on 3D models among geologists, engineers, and planners, even across distributed teams.
* **M&A Due Diligence:** Share project data securely with potential investors.
* **Community Engagement:** Simplify project explanations with local communities using visual models.

## How does CoreSync work?

1.  **Upload & Preview:** Upload your OMF file and preview your 3D model.
2.  **Verify Ownership:** Create a free account to verify ownership and control access.
3.  **Share & Collaborate:** Share your interactive 3D model with a unique URL.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Sharing & Collaboration

*   **How can I share my 3D model?**
    *   Paid plans provide a shareable URL.  Viewers don't need a CoreSync account. Sharing is not available on the Free plan.
*   **Can I collaborate with my team?**
    *   Yes! Team and Enterprise plans include collaboration features for simultaneous project access.

### Processing & Performance

*   **How long does processing take?**
    *   Most models are ready within a couple of hours, but it can take up to 24 hours depending on data size/complexity and platform demand.
*   **My model is still processing after a while. What should I do?**
    *   If processing exceeds 24 hours, contact our support team.

### Data Security

*   **How secure is CoreSync?**
    *   Data security is our top priority. CoreSync uses industry-standard encryption (TLS 1.2 for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest), secure Digital Ocean infrastructure, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions. Our security team has 24/7 on-call coverage.
* **Who has access to my models?**
    * Only users you explicitly grant access to can view or interact with your models. You maintain full control over your data.

### Supported Data & File Formats

*   **What data types can I visualize from an OMF file?**
    *   CoreSync handles various geoscience data: point data, curve data, surface data, drillholes, geophysical data, and 3D models.
*   **Do you support other file formats besides OMF?**
    *   Yes!  VTK, GEOH5, GOCAD, CSV, and OBJ support is planned for Q2 2025.
